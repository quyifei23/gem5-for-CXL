# This test is targeting stores
# Access pattern: A, C, E, G, A, I, K, M, C, A
# Each letter represents a 64-byte address range.

# The [] indicate two different sets, and each set has four ways.
# [set0way0, set0way1, set0way2, set0way3],
# [set1way0, set1way1, set1way2, set1way3],
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity,
# and each cache line is 64B. This test can be used to test the correctness of RRIP
# replacement policy. you will observe: # m, m, m, m, h, m, m, m, m, m.
# where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means hit.

# Explanation of this result:
# A, C, E, G are misses, now the cache stores ([A2, C2, E2, G2],[ , , ,]).
# The number following each letter is the RRPV for that address range.
# A is a hit, now the cache stores ([A1, C2, E2, G2],[ , , ,]).
# I searches for a victim and selects the highest RRPV C, since C
# is not saturated, A, E and G will be increased by 1,
# which it stores ([A2, I2, E3, G3],[ , , ,]).
# K searches for a victim and selects E. Now it stores ([A2, I2, K2, G3],[ , , ,]).
# M searches for a victim and selects G. Now it stores ([A2, I2, K2, M2],[ , , ,]).
# C searches for a victim and selects A. Now it stores ([C2, I3, K3, M3],[ , , ,]).
# A searches for a victim and selects I. Now it stores ([C2, A2, K3, M3],[ , , ,]).
