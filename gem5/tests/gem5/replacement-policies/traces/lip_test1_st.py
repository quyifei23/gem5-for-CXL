# This test is targeting stores
# Access pattern: A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, A, C, E, G, A, I, C
# Each letter represents a 64-byte address range.

# The [] indicate two different sets, and each set has four ways.
# [set0way0, set0way1, set0way2, set0way3],
# [set1way0, set1way1, set1way2, set1way3],
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity,
# and each cache line is 64B, with LIP replacement policy,
# you will observe: m,m,m,m,m,m,m,m,m,h,h,h,h,m,m
# where 'h' means hit and 'm' means miss.

# Explanation of this result:
# A,C,E,G are misses, now the cache stores ([A, C, E, G],[ , , ,])
# I searches for a victim and selects A.
# Now the cache stores ([I, C, E, G],[ , , ,])
# K searches for a victim and selects I.
# Now the cache stores ([K, C, E, G],[ , , ,])
# M searches for a victim and selects K.
# Now the cache stores ([M, C, E, G],[ , , ,])
# O searches for a victim and selects M.
# Now the cache stores ([O, C, E, G],[ , , ,])
# A searches for a victim and selects O.
# Now the cache stores ([A, C, E, G],[ , , ,])
# C hits --> C now MRU
# E hits --> E now MRU
# G hits --> G now MRU
# A hits --> A now MRU
# I searches for a victim and selects C since A is MRU.
# Now the cache stores ([A, I, E, G],[ , , ,]).
# C misses
