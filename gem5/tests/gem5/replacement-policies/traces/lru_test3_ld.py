# This test is targeting loads.
# Access pattern: A, C, E, G, A, C, E, G, I, A
# Each letter represents a 64-bit address range.

# The [] indicate two different sets, and each set has four ways.
# [set0way0, set0way1, set0way2, set0way3],
# [set1way0, set1way1, set1way2, set1way3],
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and each cache
# line is 64B with LRU replacement policy, you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, h, h, h, m, m, where 'h' means
# hit and 'm' means miss.

# Explanation of this result:
# A, C, E, G are misses, now the cache stores ([A*, C, E, G],[ , , ,]).
# A is marked as the LRU address range.
# A, C, E, G then hits, and the cache stores ([A*, C, E, G],[ , , ,]).
# I searches for a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores ([E, C*, I, G],[ , , ,]).
# A searches for a victim and selects C. Now the cache stores ([E, A, I*, G],[ , , ,]).
