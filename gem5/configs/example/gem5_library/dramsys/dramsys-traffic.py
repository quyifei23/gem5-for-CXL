This script is used for running a traffic generator connected to the
DRAMSys simulator.

**Important Note**: DRAMSys must be compiled into the gem5 binary to use the
DRRAMSys simulator. Please consult 'ext/dramsys/README' on how to compile
correctly. If this is not done correctly this script will run with error.
