This configuration script shows an example of how to take checkpoints for
LoopPoint using the gem5 stdlib. To take checkpoints for LoopPoint simulation
regions, there must be a LoopPoint data file generated by Pin or the gem5
simulator. With the information in the LoopPoint data file, the stdlib
modules will take checkpoints at the beginning of the simulation regions
(warmup region included if it exists) and record all restore needed information
into a JSON file. The JSON file is needed for later restoring, so please call
`looppoint.output_json_file()` at the end of the simulation.

This script builds a simple board with the gem5 stdlib with no cache and a
simple memory structure to take checkpoints. Some of the components, such as
cache hierarchy, can be changed when restoring checkpoints.
